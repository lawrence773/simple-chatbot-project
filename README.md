I've created this project just for fun, to see what putting together a simple chatbot would be like. The code is mostly OOP and OpenAI templates, and I've also used videos freely available on YouTube to get a better understanding of the structure. For now, the code has two purposes: to be funny like Ricky Gervais, and to be able to summarise past conversation up to a certain point. In the future, I plan to incorporate Langchain in the code and make something more complex out of it.
